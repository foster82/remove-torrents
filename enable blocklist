1. SSH your NAS (login as root -password is your current admin's password-)

2. Edit file /var/packages/DownloadStation/scripts/start-stop-status 
(you will want to have a look at "vi" commands for synology - http://forum.synology.com/wiki/index.ph ... _vi_Editor)


=> Disable line "rm ${PACKAGE_DIR}/etc/download/settings.json" (just add '#' to the beginning of the line)


3. Edit file /var/packages/DownloadStation/etc/download/settings.json (again use vi)

=> Set line "blocklist-enabled" to true (it will be as "false" if not done never ever before)
=> Set line "blocklist-url" to "" (it means, just delete what it's between quotes, leaving just the 2 quotes)

4. Then, back to DSM, in Control Panel -> Task Scheduler, insert the script by @unconventional as it is.

"(cd /var/packages/DownloadStation/etc/download/blocklists
sed -i -e 's|\(^\s*"blocklist-enabled":\)[^,]*|\1 true|' -e 's|\(^\s*"blocklist-url":\)[^,]*|\1 ""|' ../settings.json
wget --content-disposition "http://list.iblocklist.com/?list=bt_level1&fileformat=p2p&archiveformat=gz"
gunzip -f *.gz
rm *.bin *.gz
/var/packages/DownloadStation/target/scripts/S25download.sh restart)"
